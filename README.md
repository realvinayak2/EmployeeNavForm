# EmployeeNavForm

I have created Employee navigation form using JPDB API of Login2Xplore with CRUD functionalities.

JSONPowerDB is a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database. Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

It is basically a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services.

JPDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.
